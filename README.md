# Songkhepon

## What is Songkhepon?
Whenever we see books, what we check at first? The summary of book that is given either in the starting page, or in the last page. In this project, I have tried to retrieve those summary and put them together here. With this, you can have an initial idea about lots of books in one place.

## Why Songkhepon?
Whenever we finish a book, our hard time begins to choose the next one. Sometimes we need to spend a good number of time standing in book store and searching the book I want to read next. This is sometimes not so enjoyable. **Songkhepon** will do that for you. In this app, you can read the summaary of books from different author and decide easily that which one to read next.


## Conclusion
This was really fun while developping this project. But this a prototype version. Because of short of time, I couldn't make the full version.
